=== Release 0.8.149 ===
 * When deleting a track, the tracklist is not always properly updated, parts of the previous line may remain.
 * Because i now use QXmlStreamReader to read all Xml based config files, some historic metadata files from tracker-py with the 'missing =' bug won't read properly, causing qTracker to hang during startup. Fixing the metadata by putting the '=' sign after the version attribute in the xml tag on the first line of the file solves this. I'll look into a generic solution to fix the hangup, since even bad data should not cause the app to stall.
