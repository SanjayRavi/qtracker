=== Reload required after adding refpoint ===
One last thing - There's another bug I found: after calibrating a map, I must
terminate qtracker and load it again before I can use the calibrated map.`<BR>`
==> this should be fixed in revision 79

=== Altitude widget resets via doubltap, should be longtap ===
When doubletapping the altitude widget, it resets, while longtap does nothing.
Doubletap should bringup an options dialog (not yet implemented), longtap should reset the widget.`<BR>`
==> this should be fixed in revision 80
