Software aimed at helping hikers & geocachers to determine their position, and record & monitoring tracks, routes and waypoints. 

Platform: Qt for Symbian S60
(note that the code can also be compiled and run on non-s60 platforms, but not all
functionality is available then, e.g. GPS/Sensors/Messaging).

* Works: *
 * Show position on map
 * Show wgs84 coordinates on map
 * Speed/Altitude/Heading display
 * Min/Max altitude, trip distance, trip time display.
 * Map autoselect
 * Map zoom
 * Installation works on C: and E: (F: is untested, but should work)
 * Calibrate map
 * Track record/show/hide/delete

* Todo before 2nd alpha: *
 * Load/Save/Delete/Edit waypoints
 * Load/Save/Delete/Edit routes
 * Gpx import
 * Persistent settings (current map, zoom mode)

* Known bugs (v0.8.149) *
 * When deleting a track, the tracklist is not always properly updated, parts of the previous line may remain.
 * Because i now use QXmlStreamReader to read all Xml based config files, some historic metadata files from tracker-py with the 'missing =' bug won't read properly, causing qTracker to hang during startup. Fixing the metadata by putting the '=' sign after the version attribute in the xml tag on the first line of the file solves this. I'll look into a generic solution to fix the hangup, since even bad data should not cause the app to stall.

* Planned features: *
 * Use magnetic north sensor
 * Screensaver disable & autodisable
 * Waypoint monitor
 * Track display & recording (use server backend)
 * Route display & editing
 * Route & Track monitoring
 * Gauge options & more gauge info (average speed, descent/ascent distance, select units)

* Future: *
 * Create a plugin architecture to enable 3rd party widgets/layouts/events
