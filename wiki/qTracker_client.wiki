= qTracker v0.3 & v0.4 series =

This is essentially a port of qTracker to qml, split in a client and server part so that the client (which consumes a lot of resources) does not need to run all the time, because the server keeps track of trip and track recording data.

Although the new qTracker client and server have not yet reached the maturity of the original qTracker, it is not likely i will continue on the original code base, because the new client/server version is in many ways already much more advanced than qtracker-0.8.270
