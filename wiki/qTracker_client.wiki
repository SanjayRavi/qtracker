Platform: Qt for Symbian S60
(note that the code can also be compiled and run on non-s60 platforms, but not all
functionality is available then, e.g. GPS/Sensors/Messaging).
Note: Although initially named QmlTracker because i started it as a proof of concept, i now refer to this version as qtracker-client with qtrackerd, and the client presents itself as qtracker.
It is not likely i will continue on the original qtracker code base, since this new client/server version is in many ways already much more advanced than qtracker-0.8.270

* Works: *
 * Gauges:
   * Compass:   North up or Heading up, use sensor or gps

 * Map zoom
 * Map centers on & follows gps position
 * Installation works on C: and E: (F: is untested, but should work)
