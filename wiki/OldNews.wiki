  I found an interesting project online: Proj.4, which seems
  to be aimed at providing a library that can do projection
  conversions. I'm going to see if i can use it to implement
  most of the datums i use.

  It looks like the 'Tower' Qt 4.5 prerelease for S60 is no 
  longer available, and is now replaced with the 'Colossus' 
  4.6 beta. I'm not sure if qTracker is binary compatible
  with this new beta.

  The latest Qt packages can be found here:

  <b>Update:</b><br>
  I've uploaded a new sis built against Qt 4.6 colossus.
  Although i see a little degradation in the handling of the SVG
  images, most functionality is on par with the previous release.
